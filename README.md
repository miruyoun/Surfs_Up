# Surfs Up

## Overview
In this analysis, I set out to look for more information about temperature trends around Oahu. Specifically, I looked at temperature data in June, and December, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round.

## Results
Based off our summary statistics...
* Mean June temperatures are about 75 °F which is 4 degrees higher than the mean December temperatures of 71 °F.
* Temperatures are more variable in December than in June, since December has a greater range and standard deviation.
  * As a result, June has a narrower distribution of temperatures than December.
* There are more temperature records from June than from December, which suggests that temperatures are more consistent in June.

### June Summary Statistics

### December Summary Statistics

### Summary
We can see that temperature trends follow what we expect year-round in Oahu. Since Oahu is close to the equator, the temperatures there are generally warmer and are less variable compared to places that are further from the equator. Based on our results, setting up a surf and ice cream shop business would be profitable for most of the year. Although we saw temperatures drop to 56 °F, limiting the production of ice cream and surfboards around the winter season would also prevent money loss.

Although there are some differences between the two groups of queries (all vs. recent data), the temperature in Oahu is generally cool/warm. As a result, if temperature trends remain consistent, the surf and ice cream store would be profitable year-round.
